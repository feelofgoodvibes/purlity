2. Install dependencies (`pip install -r requirements.txt`)
3. Create `.env` file, and define `SECRET_KEY='your-secret-key'` there
4. Apply migrations to database:
  `flask --app src.app db upgrade`
5. Run application using `python run.py`

ðŸŽ‰ App is up and running (by default http://localhost:5000)
